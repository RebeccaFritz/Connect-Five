# Connect-Five
Connect Five Algorithm

This is a connect five algorithm written as the final project for Discrete Structures at the University of Dallas. The file FritzFP.java implements the FinalProject.java interface 
written by the Computer Science teachers, Hochberg and Chastain, at that school. The primary methods are playShortGame() and playLongGame(). The short game is played until one player
gets five in a row, column, or diagonal. The long game is played unitl the board is full and the winner is based on the most sets of five.
